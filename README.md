I was frustrated with Reddit Enhancement Suite because whenever I clicked on a video or text expando button, the link wouldn't turn purple. 

So I put together this little chrome extension to do that for me...and then I decided I also wanted to sync all the links I visited on one computer accross all my computers. I think Reddit does that for you anyways if you are signed in...but whatever.
